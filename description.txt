The Havoc Mod is another content mod that aims to enhance the experience of Vanilla gameplay, and to be playable alongside many other mods.
Havoc has undergone development for over a year by now, and has integrated with GabeHasWon's swamp biome over that timespan. While Havoc is still a WIP, its content makes for a reasonably balanced playthrough, all the way up to post-Moon Lord weapons.
Current Content:
-2 Bosses
-34 Weapons
-2 Armor Sets
-1 Accessory
-The Swamp, a murky biome found both underground and on the surface.
